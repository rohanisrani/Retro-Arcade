<p> This is the Final Project for Bayside High Schools Sophmore Computer Science Class

The objective was to create a game using Flappy Bird and Zombie Thanksgiving as inspiration
so I decided to create an arcade where you can choose between the game and enhancements to the base game.

The Game is called Retro Arcade </p>
